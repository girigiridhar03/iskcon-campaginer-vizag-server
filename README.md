# ISKCON Vizag Server

Backend API for the ISKCON Vizag campaign and donation platform. This service powers the public campaign experience, the admin dashboard, campaigner onboarding, donation tracking, receipt generation, and payment lifecycle handling used by the client app in `iskcon-vizag-client/iskcon-vizag`.

## What This Server Does

- Manages fundraising campaigns and campaigners
- Supports admin and devotee authentication with JWT
- Creates donation orders through Razorpay
- Verifies successful payments through both direct verification and Razorpay webhooks
- Stores donor, payment, seva, media, and devotee data in MongoDB
- Uploads campaigner images to Google Cloud Storage
- Generates downloadable PDF receipts from a template
- Sends WhatsApp notifications for onboarding, donation alerts, and receipts
- Pushes donation data to the external DCC API after successful payment capture

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express 5
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Razorpay
- Google Cloud Storage
- JWT authentication
- Multer + Sharp for image uploads
- `pdf-lib` for receipt generation
- Axios/FormData for external integrations

## Repository Context

This repository has two main apps:

- `iskcon-vizag-server`: this backend API
- `iskcon-vizag-client/iskcon-vizag`: the Vite/React frontend

The frontend `.env.example` points to:

```env
VITE_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:2345/api
```

So during local development, the server is expected to run on port `2345` by default.

## Core Domain Models

- `Campaign`: fundraiser metadata, target amount, raised amount, active/upcoming/closed status
- `Campaigner`: fundraiser participant tied to a campaign and a temple devotee
- `Donation`: donor details, amount, payment state, PAN, address, seva, receipt info
- `Payment`: Razorpay order/payment mapping and raw gateway payloads
- `TempleDevote`: devotee/preacher record mapped to a login account
- `Register`: login identity for `admin` and `devotee`
- `Seva`: donation-related seva categories, codes, amounts, and points
- `Media`: reusable uploaded image metadata

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values.

```env
DB_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/data"
PORT=2345

GCS_PROJECT_ID=""
GCS_BUCKET_NAME=""
GCS_CREDENTIALS=''

RAZORPAY_API_KEY=""
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=""
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=""

JWT_SECRET=""

FLAXXA_TOKEN=""

DCC_API_KEY=""
DCC_API=""
```

### Variable Notes

- `DB_URL`: MongoDB connection string
- `PORT`: API port; frontend expects `2345` locally
- `GCS_PROJECT_ID`: Google Cloud project id
- `GCS_BUCKET_NAME`: bucket used for campaigner image storage
- `GCS_CREDENTIALS`: stringified service account JSON; the code parses this value and restores newlines in `private_key`
- `RAZORPAY_API_KEY`: public Razorpay key returned to the client when creating donation orders
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`: server-side Razorpay secret for signature verification
- `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: used to validate `/api/webhooks/razorpay`
- `JWT_SECRET`: signs and verifies auth tokens
- `FLAXXA_TOKEN`: token for WhatsApp template message delivery
- `DCC_API_KEY`: auth key for the downstream DCC API
- `DCC_API`: endpoint that receives donation payloads after successful payment capture

## Installation

```bash
cd iskcon-vizag-server
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Update `.env`, then start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production-style startup:

```bash
npm start
```

## Running Locally

1. Start MongoDB and make sure `DB_URL` is reachable.
2. Create `iskcon-vizag-server/.env` from `.env.example`.
3. Fill in Razorpay, JWT, GCS, WhatsApp, and DCC values.
4. Start the backend with `npm run dev`.
5. Start the frontend separately from `iskcon-vizag-client/iskcon-vizag`.

Once running:

- API base URL: `http://localhost:2345/api`
- Health endpoint: `http://localhost:2345/health`

## Authentication and Roles

The server uses Bearer tokens in the `Authorization` header.

- `admin`: full access across campaigns, sevas, devotees, campaigners, dashboard, and donor management
- `devotee`: limited operational access focused on their assigned campaigners and dashboard data

Relevant middleware:

- `verifyToken`: requires a valid JWT
- `optionalAuth`: attaches user info when a token is present but does not block anonymous access
- `onlyAdmin`: admin-only routes
- `authorizeRole("admin", "devotee")`: shared protected routes

## API Overview

All routes below are mounted from `app.js`.

### Health

### Media

## Payment Flow

The donation/payment lifecycle in the current code is:

1. Client calls `POST /api/donations/create-order`
2. Server creates a pending `Donation`
3. Server creates a Razorpay order and stores a `Payment` document
4. Client completes Razorpay checkout
5. Server confirms payment either through:
   - `POST /api/payment/verify`, or
   - `POST /api/webhooks/razorpay`
6. On successful capture the server:
   - marks donation as `success`
   - stores gateway ids and raw payment data
   - increments campaign and campaigner raised totals
   - sends donation data to the DCC API
   - triggers WhatsApp notifications
   - enables receipt download

## File Upload and Media Handling

- Uploads are stored in memory using Multer
- Images are compressed and resized with Sharp before upload
- Files are uploaded to Google Cloud Storage
- Public image URLs are saved in the `Media` and `Campaigner` records

## Receipt Generation

Receipts are generated dynamically from `receipt-template.pdf` using `pdf-lib`.

The generated PDF fills fields such as:

- donor name
- phone number
- amount and amount in words
- transaction date
- address
- PAN / 80G flag
- email
- gateway payment id
- enrolled-by short form

## External Integrations

### Razorpay

Used for:

- order creation
- payment signature verification
- webhook processing

### Google Cloud Storage

Used for:

- campaigner image storage

### Flaxxa WhatsApp API

Used for:

- campaigner onboarding messages
- donation notifications
- receipt delivery

### DCC API

Used for:

- forwarding successful donation data and storing returned receipt metadata

## Deployment Files

The repo already includes:

- `Dockerfile`
- `cloudbuild.yaml`

These indicate the service is intended to be containerized and deployable through Google Cloud Build or a similar container workflow.

## Response Shape

Most JSON responses follow a common helper format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "statusCode": 200,
  "message": "Some message",
  "data": {}
}
```

## CORS Configuration

The server currently allows requests from:

- `http://localhost:5173`
- `https://iskcon-campaginer-vizag-client.vercel.app`
- `https://campaigns.harekrishnavizag.org`

If you add a new frontend domain, update the `allowedOrigin` array in `app.js`.

## Known Implementation Notes

- There is no automated test suite configured yet; `npm test` currently exits with a placeholder error.
- `POST /api/campaign` is currently not protected in `routes/campaign.route.js`, so access control for campaign creation may need review.
- `POST /api/register` accepts `role` from the request header, which is flexible for setup but should be protected carefully in production environments.
- The GCS credentials are expected as a JSON string in a single environment variable, not as a file path.

## Useful Local Checks

```bash
curl http://localhost:2345/health
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:2345/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"password"}'
```

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev     # start with nodemon
npm start       # start with node
```
